Title: Booked

Description: A mobile trading application between university students 

Status: Working, but needs a few visual and systematic improvements

So Far: Firstly, the user enters the app using their "edu.tr" mails. We used Firebase Auth to send verification mails and check the credentials of the user. We also allowed the 
user to reset their passwords, sign up, and sign in. After logging in the user is in the Main Page We have implemented the Showroom where we list all the posts in our app and also we can make detailed searchs, filterings, and sortings in there. We also have user profiles (shows
detailed info about social media, contact and also allows the user to surf through many pages) and other user's profile. Also, the user now can pick an avatar using the "File Picker"
of Android. We also have My Posts page where the user can see all of their posts and also a wishlist where user can add the books they desire. We also implemented Book Profile 
that shows all the posts about a book and also evaluations of other people to it. Besides that, we have implemented the Post Page where detailed information about a post can be seen. As other
improvements, we have Edit Profile, Add Post, and Edit Post pages. Lastly, we have implemented Settings page which allows the user various actions to perform.

What's Left: Database storage connection in some activities, notifications, and also image connection.
